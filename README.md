# Nexys_DDR4_Sound_Recorder
Read data from Pmod MIC&amp; Store sound into block memory&amp; Play back

This project was created by vivado 2017.1.
Code is a little bit messy, maybe improve it some day.
* MIC is [PModMIC3](https://reference.digilentinc.com/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=pmod:pmod:pmodMIC3_rm.pdf) made by digilent
* Sound is generated by a PWM generator
* HAVE FUN :)
